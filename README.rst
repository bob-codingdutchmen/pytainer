A Python package to help deploy projects to portainer

This package uses (a small subset of) the Portainer API to make
updating and deploying stacks easier. The main use case is Continuous
Integration / Deployment.

As this is build around my personal needs, don't expect a comprehensive
implementation to manage a complete Portainer install.


Features
--------

* Update a portainer stack with a stack file and env vars
